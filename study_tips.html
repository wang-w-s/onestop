				<p>Good study habits have always been important, but with the COVID-19 pandemic, good study habits matter more now than ever. The extra differences from the norm may cause many students feel more stress and pressure. Below are some tips to help you relieve some stress and succeed in your studying, regardless of whether school may be online or in-person.</p>

						<div class="sub">Tip #1: Spaced Repetition</div>
						<div class="descrip">
							<p>"Don't cram before a big test." This is probably one of the most well-known study tips out there, but it really does work. Many studies show that repetitively studying over a course of several days can improve your memory by quite a lot. In this way, you train yourself to remember content for longer and longer periods of time.</p>

						<div class="sub" style="text-align: right;">Tip #2: Mix It Up</div>
						<div class="descrip" style="text-align: right;">
							<p>Studying repetitively is most definitely effective, but try to change up how you do so every session! Don't just focus on one topic or style of practice. Leave yourself open to new options like flashcards or maybe practice tests!</p>

						<div class="sub">Tip #3: Digging Deeper</div>
						<div class="descrip">
							<p>One of the most effective ways of learning a certain concept is by looking for more information, more than what you may need to know. Asking yourself why something may be and finding examples of a concept can be one of the easiest ways to help your brain combine and network new information!</p>

						<div class="sub" style="text-align: right;">Tip #4: Studying with Others</div>
						<div class="descrip" style="text-align: right;">
							<p>Sure, studying alone is the norm, but it can definitely help to form study groups with others. Studying with others can be a great way to test your comprehension of topics and motivate yourself to study more on a set time schedule!</p>

						<div class="sub">Tip #5: Change of Setting</div>
						<div class="descrip">
							<p>Personally, this is one of the tips that helps me the most. Changing <em>where</em> you study can give a nice change of pace and allow you to focus more effectively. Not only can it be less boring, it can improve your retention as well!</p>
